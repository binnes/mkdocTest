# GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages){target=_blank} provide the option for GitHub to host a static website for a project.

By default when you create a new repository there is no GitHub Pages site creates, but you can easily configure a site.

To configure GitHub Pages you need to use the GitHub web console and navigate into your project.
